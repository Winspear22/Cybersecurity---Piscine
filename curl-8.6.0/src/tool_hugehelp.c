"NAME\n"
"       curl - transfer a URL\n"
"\n"
"SYNOPSIS\n"
"       curl [options / URLs]\n"
"\n"
"DESCRIPTION\n"
"       curl is a tool for transferring data from or to a server using URLs. It\n"
"       supports these protocols: DICT, FILE, FTP, FTPS, GOPHER, GOPHERS, HTTP,\n"
, stdout);
 fputs(
"       HTTPS,  IMAP, IMAPS, LDAP, LDAPS, MQTT, POP3, POP3S, RTMP, RTMPS, RTSP,\n"
"       SCP, SFTP, SMB, SMBS, SMTP, SMTPS, TELNET, TFTP, WS and WSS.\n"
"\n"
"       curl is powered by  libcurl  for  all  transfer-related  features.  See\n"
"       libcurl(3) for details.\n"
"\n"
"URL\n"
"       The  URL  syntax is protocol-dependent. You find a detailed description\n"
"       in RFC 3986.\n"
"\n"
"       If you provide a URL without a leading protocol:// scheme, curl guesses\n"
, stdout);
 fputs(
"       what  protocol  you  want.  It then defaults to HTTP but assumes others\n"
"       based on often-used host name prefixes. For  example,  for  host  names\n"
"       starting with \"ftp.\" curl assumes you want FTP.\n"
"\n"
"       You  can  specify  any  amount  of  URLs  on the command line. They are\n"
"       fetched in a sequential manner in the specified order  unless  you  use\n"
"       -Z, --parallel. You can specify command line options and URLs mixed and\n"
"       in any order on the command line.\n"
"\n"
, stdout);
 fputs(
"       curl attempts to reuse connections when doing  multiple  transfers,  so\n"
"       that  getting  many files from the same server do not use multiple con-\n"
"       nects and setup handshakes. This improves speed. Connection  reuse  can\n"
"       only  be  done  for URLs specified for a single command line invocation\n"
"       and cannot be performed between separate curl runs.\n"
"\n"
"       Provide an IPv6 zone id in the URL with  an  escaped  percentage  sign.\n"
"       Like in\n"
"\n"
, stdout);
 fputs(
"       \"http://[fe80::3%25eth0]/\"\n"
"\n"
"       Everything  provided on the command line that is not a command line op-\n"
"       tion or its argument, curl assumes is a URL and treats it as such.\n"
"\n"
"GLOBBING\n"
"       You can specify multiple URLs or parts of URLs by writing lists  within\n"
"       braces or ranges within brackets. We call this \"globbing\".\n"
"\n"
"       Provide a list with three different names like this:\n"
"\n"
"       \"http://site.{one,two,three}.com\"\n"
"\n"
, stdout);
 fputs(
"       Do sequences of alphanumeric series by using [] as in:\n"
"\n"
"       \"ftp://ftp.example.com/file[1-100].txt\"\n"

"       With leading zeroes:\n"
"\n"
"       \"ftp://ftp.example.com/file[001-100].txt\"\n"
"\n"
"       With letters through the alphabet:\n"
"\n"
"       \"ftp://ftp.example.com/file[a-z].txt\"\n"
"\n"
"       Nested  sequences  are not supported, but you can use several ones next\n"
"       to each other:\n"
"\n"
"       \"http://example.com/archive[1996-1999]/vol[1-4]/part{a,b,c}.html\"\n"
"\n"
, stdout);

"\n"
"       \"http://example.com/file[a-z:2].txt\"\n"
"\n"
"       When  using [] or {} sequences when invoked from a command line prompt,\n"
"       you probably have to put the full URL within double quotes to avoid the\n"
"       shell  from  interfering  with  it. This also goes for other characters\n"
"       treated special, like for example '&', '?' and '*'.\n"
"\n"
, stdout);
 fputs(
"       Switch off globbing with -g, --globoff.\n"
"\n"
"VARIABLES\n"
"       curl supports command line variables (added in  8.3.0).  Set  variables\n"
"       with  --variable name=content or --variable name@file (where \"file\" can\n"
"       be stdin if set to a single dash (-)).\n"
"\n"
"       Variable contents can be expanded in option parameters using \"{{name}}\"\n"
"       (without  the  quotes) if the option name is prefixed with \"--expand-\".\n"
"       This gets the contents of the variable \"name\" inserted, or a  blank  if\n"
, stdout);
 fputs(
"       the  name  does  not  exist  as a variable. Insert \"{{\" verbatim in the\n"
"       string by prefixing it with a backslash, like \"\\{{\".\n"
"\n"
"       You an access and expand environment variables by first importing them.\n"
"       You  can select to either require the environment variable to be set or\n"
"       you can provide a default value in case it is not  already  set.  Plain\n"
"       --variable  %name  imports the variable called 'name' but exits with an\n"
, stdout);
 fputs(
"       error if that environment variable is not already set. To provide a de-\n"
"       fault  value  if it is not set, use --variable %name=content or --vari-\n"
"       able %name@content.\n"
"\n"
"       Example. Get the USER environment variable into the URL, fail  if  USER\n"

"\n"
"       --variable '%USER'\n"
"       --expand-url = \"https://example.com/api/{{USER}}/method\"\n"
"\n"
"       When  expanding  variables,  curl  supports a set of functions that can\n"

"       and  trailing  white  space  with trim, it can output the contents as a\n"
"       JSON quoted string with json, URL encode the string with url or  base64\n"

"OUTPUT\n"
"       If  not told otherwise, curl writes the received data to stdout. It can\n"
, stdout);
 fputs(
"       be instructed to instead save that data into a local  file,  using  the\n"

"       URLs to transfer on the command line, it similarly needs  multiple  op-\n"
"       tions for where to save them.\n"
"\n"
"       curl  does  not  parse or otherwise \"understand\" the content it gets or\n"
